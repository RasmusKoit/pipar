Mouse bites KiCad footprints

Mouse bites on a PCB (Printed Circuit Board) are small, perforated tabs along the edges of the board, often used to allow multiple boards to be fabricated together in a single panel and then easily separated. These small holes are typically placed in a line along the edge where the board will be snapped apart, somewhat resembling the perforations on a postage stamp.

The main purpose of mouse bites is to simplify the manufacturing process by allowing multiple PCBs to be produced together and then separated by breaking them along the perforated lines. After separation, the edge where the mouse bites were located can sometimes have a rough finish, which may need to be filed down or sanded to ensure a smooth edge, especially if the PCB will be housed in a case.
