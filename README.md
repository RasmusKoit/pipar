# Pipar PCBs

ZMK firmware for the Pipar PCBs.

[![.github/workflows/build_pipar_firmwares.yml](https://github.com/RasmusKoit/pipar/actions/workflows/build_pipar_firmwares.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/RasmusKoit/pipar/actions/workflows/build_pipar_firmwares.yml)

**Pipar** is a collection of different keyboards and keypads that I have designed. Each PCB in the series has unique features tailored to different needs and preferences.

## Designed PCBs

PCB Files for each keyboard/project has been seperated into their own folders. The PCBs are designed in KiCad v8.0

Currently, the following PCBs are available:

- [Pipar & Sool](#pipar-ja-sool-pepper-and-salt) - 36-key split wireless keyboard with a 3x5+3 layout and a dongle.
- [Pipar Point](#pipar-point) - 36-key split wireless keyboard with a 3x5+3 layout, trackpoint, LEDs and a dongle.
- [Pipar Flake](#pipar-flake) - 8+1 key wireless keypad with a rotary encoder and a screen.

#### Pipar ja Sool Design Details

> [!NOTE]
> The V3 design is compatible with the V2 case.

- **Layout**: Splayed split keyboard with a 3x5+3 layout.
  - **Thumb Cluster**: Three keys on each half.
  - **Outer Columns**: Split to reduce the distance to the keys.
- **Wireless**: Uses the XIAO BLE microcontroller for both halves and a dongle.
- **Battery**: Larger area for the battery to ensure longer usage time.
- **LEDs**: I sometimes miss the visual feedback of the LEDs, so I added them to the design.

Changenotes:

V3 version has went with the route of using smaller components with the 0403/SOD-323 package for resistors and diodes. The design is also compatible with the V2 case, so the case can be used with the V3 PCB.
V3 also has the added benefit of using solder nuts for mounting the PCB to the case, instead of just holes for M2 screws. This adds more possibilities for mounting the PCB to the case.

#### Pipar Point Design Details

- **Layout**: Splayed split keyboard with a 3x5+3+2  layout.
  - **Thumb Cluster**: Three keys on each half.
  - **Outer Columns**: Split to reduce the distance to the keys. Extra Keys for macros or foreign letters
- **Wireless**: Uses BLE with PCB Antenna
- **Battery**: Larger area for the battery to ensure longer usage time.
- **Trackpoint**: Lenovo T460S Trackpoint for mouse control on the right side.
- **LEDs**: I sometimes miss the visual feedback of the LEDs, so I added them to the design.
- **Top Plate**: Designed to be used with a top plate for a more rigid build.

Idea was to iterate on the Pipar ja Sool design and add a trackpoint for mouse control. The design is still in the early stages and will be updated as the project progresses. Because of the trackpoint, LEDs and the battery size has been increased to 2500mAh to compensate for the power draw of the trackpoint and LEDs. With this design, I am aiming to challege myself to design a more complex PCB by using more components which will also be smaller in size. The design will also include a top plate to make the build more rigid, because the possibility of using choc v1/v2 switches.

I want to thank [zhiayang/Mikoto](https://github.com/zhiayang/mikoto) and [Hello9999901/laptop](https://github.com/Hello9999901/laptop/tree/main/keyboard) for making this project possible. As the schematic & NRF52840 placement is based on their work.
